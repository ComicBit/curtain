# Curtain - Chrome Extension

![Curtain Icon](renditions/large.jpg)

Curtain is a Chrome extension designed to give you control over visual elements on webpages. With Curtain, you can hide images, videos, SVGs, and backgrounds, or apply a greyscale filter to reduce distractions and create a more focused browsing experience.

## Features

- **Hide Images, Videos, SVGs, and Backgrounds**: Customize your browsing experience by toggling the visibility of these elements.
- **Greyscale Mode**: Apply a greyscale filter to all visual elements on a webpage.
- **Persistent Settings**: Your preferences are saved per website, so they are automatically applied every time you visit.
- **Easy Control Panel**: Access all settings through a sleek and intuitive control panel.

## Installation
